# Simple graph visualizer

A quick-and-dirty interactive graph visualizer, based on the vis.js library

How to use:
- replace `graph-data.js` with the graph of your own choice:
  you have to supply `DATA.nodes` and `.edges`,
  and preferably also `DATA.version`
- edit `graph-settings.js` to match your graph:
  at least `SETTINGS.nodes`, `.edges` and `.graphs` should be updated
- navigate to `graph-visualizer.html` in your favourite browser

Here's how it should look if you don't change anything:
